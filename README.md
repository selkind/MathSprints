# MathSprints
### A module that enables the creation of highly-customizeable mathematical problem sets with: 

* #### Desktop application with intuitive UI for user-generated worksheets (in progress)
* #### tools that facilitate grading (future development)
* #### loadable problem sets that target mastery of common-core standard modules (future development)
* #### A web UI for user-generated worksheets (future development)



This repository originated in response to a problem described to me by an elementary school math teacher.
The thing that their students needed most was repetitious practice with problem sets that focused on a single concept. 
This sort of exercise would expose students to the patterns of fundamental arithmetic for which mastery is
necessary in order to progress to more complex mathematical topics.

There are several problems for the teacher with this kind of class exercise; even for 5-10 minutes of daily practice:
* It generates excessive material for grading. (relatively immediate feedback is valuable for instructors to gauge students' progress)
* Finding material that corresponds to the current topic is time consuming, especially in a class with students who's abilities
can vary by multiple grade level.
* Availibility of material that directly matches the fine-granularity of concepts defined by common-core standards can be 
difficult or impossible to find.
* The solutions to these problems (that I've researched in a very limited capacity) are behind paywalls. 

This project is an endeavour to learn how to create GUIs, practice my git workflow, and work on a larger-scale project.
I would be very happy to incorporate the contributions of others into this project. I will do my best to actively communicate
with potential contributors and keep the issues tab active with known bugs, and specifications for new or modified features.
